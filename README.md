# Politics and the media

The media should take some responsability for the density of reports on a particular subject can become a self fulfulling prophecy.

In this example, we look at how the number of mentions of a political party affects their position in the polls. I'm not looking at positive or negative mentions, this works on the premise that even negative coverage has a positive affect.

## Scoring system:

- **Mentioned in headline**: 2 points
- **Mentioned in article**: 1 point

Points are only calculated one (multiple mentions won't acrue more points).

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

```bash
$ python app.py
